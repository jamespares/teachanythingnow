1. Reddit Strategy (High Traffic, High Risk)
  Goal: Be helpful first, self-promote second.

  Top Subreddits to Target:
   1. r/Teachers (Wait for "Sunday Scaries" or "Lesson Planning" threads)
   2. r/edtech (Best for direct feedback)
   3. r/EducationalAI (Your core audience)
   4. r/ChatGPT (Search for "teacher" or "lesson plan" posts)
   5. r/InstructionalDesign (For the corporate training angle)

Key words: Burnout/Sunday planning

"I used to spend hours on Sunday formatting slides too. I came across this tool (I think it was made by an indie hacker) that generates the PPT +
  Worksheet + Audio all at once from just a topic. It’s called Teach Anything Now (teachanythingnow.com). It's a bit rough around the edges still, but it might save you a few hours tonight. Good luck!"

 2. YouTube Strategy (SEO & Longevity)
  Goal: Catch users when they are actively looking for solutions.

  Channels to Watch & Comment On:
   * AI Teaching Tools (Highly relevant)
   * New EdTech Classroom (Thom Gibson)
   * Alice Keeler (Google Classroom expert)
   * Pocketful of Primary (Huge teacher audience)
   * Matt Wolfe (General AI - good for "Look what I built" comments)

   "Great video! One thing I've found missing in ChatGPT is getting the actual files (PPT/Word). I built a small tool
  that connects the dots and gives you the downloadable PPTx and Docx directly: teachanythingnow.com. Hope it helps
  someone here!"
