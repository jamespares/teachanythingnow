## Excalifont

To use Excalifont (handwritten whiteboard-style font) for the hero title:

1. Download Excalifont from: https://plus.excalidraw.com/excalifont/
2. Extract the font files
3. Place the following files in this directory:
   - `Excalifont.woff2` (preferred)
   - `Excalifont.woff` (fallback)
   - `Excalifont.ttf` (fallback)

The font is free under OFL-1.1 license and can be used for both personal and commercial projects.

**Note:** Until Excalifont files are added, the hero title will use Caveat or Kalam (Google Fonts) as fallback fonts, which provide a similar handwritten style.
